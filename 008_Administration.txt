Running
- Upnack, run from wherever
- DB store defaults to /data/db, configurable
* Can use different datastore for different DBs on same machine
* Use case: SSD for random server, HDD for normal

Mongo Shell
- Can run commands from Mongo shell
* runProgram('program', 'args')

Statistics and Utilities
- db.stats()
* Stats for entire database, including system DBs
- db.collection.stats()
* Stats for a specific collection
- db.serverStatus()
* Information about the server itself

Other useful tools
- mongostat
- iostat
* % utilization for disks
* Determine need for more resources (faster disks, SSD, sharding, etc.)
- astat

Current status of server: db.currentOp()
- Info on current operating queries, who started them, etc.


Replication
- Define slave with --master option
- Can set delays on replication
* Use case: stop accidental commands from replication
- Irresponsible to go into prod without it

Other Miscellaneous Bits
- Make sure that inits scripts shut down cleanly
* --fork, --logpath
