Location Data - Sandeep Parikh

Different types of location data

Different sources too
- Twitter
- checking services
- etc.

Strategy used: Dump, analyze, modify

Mongo native support
- 2D geospatial indxing
* Find closest N things
* Mix in other queries (closest museums)
- Store as Lat/Lng array (order doesn't matter if consistent)

Query
- $near / geoNear
- $within ($box/$circle)
- No polygons (yet)


Takeaway
- Dumping raw data into Mongo allows for more flexible data mining
* Over using just API queries to do work
